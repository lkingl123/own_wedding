        <h1>Marjorie Itabashi</h1>
        <p>
            I was born in the middle of the summer with no a/c to a Japanese father and American Mother in Chiba, Japan. Raised with 4 other children as the oldest aka guinea pig of the pack, I always enjoyed having fun with people, being active, adventurous, and independent. Moving to Utah for high school, I was introduced to many cultures and learned to celebrate them. During this time, I also gained interest in personal growth through tourism college courses, late babysitting nights, and working for a marketing company. After serving my church mission in the countryside of the Japan Kobe Mission, I decided to go back to school by attending LDS Business College to study Project Management. Upon receiving my associate’s degree, I transferred to Brigham Young University Hawaii to study Hospitality and Tourism Management. While I loved the industry, and worked in various parts of it, the difficulty of employment during the Covid-19 pandemic led me back to Utah where I currently work for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints headquarters. Since I get to do customer support for Japan, I work in the evenings, allowing me to have the warm day time be my free time. Part of that is spent helping at a daycare where I get to experience high energy and mental healing through adoring children. Most of my other free time is spent hiking, going to the gym, and working on my small garden. During the winter I mostly just enjoy eating. Even though I found Jake to be a little cocky at first, I agreed to meet him because he offered free food upfront. Some of my favorite things about him is that he likes crunchy fries so that I can eat the soggy ones and how he would do steep hikes with me even the day after leg day. I can’t be grateful enough to explore life’s journey with someone who is just as crazy about life as I am.

            Originating from vibrant and culturally diverse Malaysia, my journey to the United States in 2014 has been a thrilling pursuit of knowledge and a passion for diverse interests. My journey began as I landed in Alaska serving as a missionary for the LDS church.

I completed my studies at Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYU-I), where I cultivated a solid foundation of knowledge. My educational adventure continued at Utah Valley University (UVU) and the University of Utah (U of U), broadening my horizons.

My fascination with technology is an ever-present delight. From exploring the nuances of artificial intelligence to keeping up with the latest advancements, I enjoy staying at the forefront of innovation, fueling my analytical thinking and sparking innovative solutions to complex problems.

Beyond academics and technology, I enjoy basketball and hitting the gym. The court and gym are both a sanctuary where I express my competitive spirit and dedication to build my yin and yang. My commitment to self-improvement extends to the gym, where I continuously strive to better myself, both physically and mentally.

Embracing personal development as a way of life, I'm driven by a thirst for knowledge and growth. This guiding philosophy encourages me to evolve and contribute positively to the world around me.

In summary, my journey from Malaysia to the United States is a transformative adventure marked by a commitment to education, a deep passion for technology, and an unwavering pursuit of self-improvement and a reminder of my wonderful supportive family members. With enthusiasm and a thirst for self-discovery, I eagerly anticipate the exciting adventures and opportunities that await me in the future with Marjorie.
